"(To Yahiko and Nagato ) "" Yahiko and Nagato… I will be the support that holds both our bridges up! "" [28]"
"(To Jiraiya ) "" You have no idea what happened to us after you left, sensei. "" [29]"
"(To Jiraiya) "" I have received the will of god and I must kill you. "" [30]"
"(To Jiraiya) "" That time, you should have listened to what Orochimaru said, but you saved us instead. Now, it's too late as we act to make his plans a reality. "" [31]"
"(To Naruto ) "" Nagato believed in you, so I believe in you, too. "" [32]"
"(To Naruto) "" This time… I hope for you these will be flowers of hope that never die. "" [33]"
"(To Tobi ) "" I knew you'd come find me eventually. I've been waiting for my chance to destroy you. "" [34]"
"(To Tobi about Naruto) "" He is light personified. That's why everyone he meets… carries the flower called hope ! "" [35]"
"(To Tobi) "" Yahiko founded the Akatsuki. The red clouds on these robes we wear… represent the wars that rained blood upon Amegakure. You merely jumped in our bandwagon. These robes are our legacy, not yours. The Rinnegan is something that Amegakure shinobi Nagato awakened on his own, and it does not belong to you! His eyes are this nation and village's greatest treasure!! "" [36]"
"(To Tobi) "" One question… Madara. Do you understand why we betrayed you? Because you are darkness , a world without light where flowers can only wither and die! "" [14]"
"(To Tobi) "" Yahiko and Nagato did what they wanted to do. They were never your pawns! No matter what happened to them, they both fought for their own ideals! And that's why their will has been passed down! I won't let you ruin it! "" [37]"
"(To Tobi) "" Yahiko and Nagato's will hasn't vanished from this world! I believe in Naruto too! He… He will become the bridge that leads us to peace and I will be a support holding the bridge up! "" [38]"
