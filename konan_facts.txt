Konan fromNarutodeserved way better than what she received.
As the only female member ofthe Akatsuki, Konan acted asNagato'sーotherwise known as Pain'sーpartner during the Pain's Invasion Arc.
She had the unique jutsu of using paper and crafting origami to attack her foes and was an S-rank ninja.
However, despite her unfortunate death byTobiーand in the cheapest way possibleーnot much is known about Konan.
Luckily, there are some details the author disclosed about her.
There are a few facts about Konan many may not have known, and for curious fans who loved her character, here are ten.
Despite Konan appearing with a youthful appearance like anadult in her mid-20s, Konan is actually 35-years-old.
Konan, Nagato, and Yahiko met the Sannin when they were childrenーand when Orochimaru was still with the Hidden Leaf Village.
Konan is one of the longest living ninja in Naruto, despite her early death during the halfway point ofNaruto,which was thePain's Invasion Arc.
The Hyuuga and Uchiha Clans aren't the only ones who are capable of sensing and seeing chakra.
Konan was asensory type ninja, meaning she could detect enemies' chakra and sensing impending danger.
As a sensory type, Konan was also able to detect chakra from miles away, meaning she was a formidable opponent during battle.
Unfortunately, this wasn't explored more as it should have been and was left to use only during convenient times.
This applied to bothKonan and Nagato.
The Akatsuki is composed of missing-ninーshort for missing ninjaーwho deserted their village.
However, unlike the rest of the Akatsuki who abandoned their villages to become missing-ninja, Konan and Nagato were never branded as such.
This is because they won during the Village Hidden by Rain civil wars.
Before Kamui was known by an official name, characters called it a space-time jutsu.
Whenever Tobi utilized it, characters would not know how to react, or what type of jutsu it was, causing them fear.
However, Konan was different.
Konan studied Tobi's Kamui so she could kill him one day, as she believed he was leading the Akatsuki astray.
She understood Kamui so well that Tobi had to rely on Izanami, and not the former jutsu, to outsmart and defeat her in battle.
Yahiko, Nagato, and Konan were all war orphans because of the Second Shinobi World War.
However, she did have a birthday before her parents were killedーit was February 20.
Every character, no matter how big or small, has a favorite food.
In Konan's case, her favorite food was said to be flame-broiled fish in a Naruto Data Book.
The Data Book released information about her least favorite food, which was karaage.
Konan was not shown as much in the anime when compared to other characters, but it turns out she had even less time in the manga.
Although Konan's intentions were not known until after Nagato had sacrificed himself, they were barely known in the manga before she was defeated by Tobi.
Because she was shown more in the anime, more fans lamented with her death in comparison.
Konan's jutsu allows her to use paper to defeat her opponents.
However, she genuinely enjoyed making origami and such with her jutsu before the war occurred and she lost her family.
Konan's hobbies, as stated by the Naruto Data Book, were making origami and flower pressing.
Her hobbies match her character, as she always had a light blue flower in her hair.
It turns out that these feelings were reincorporated, as shown inNarutochapter 511.
Yahiko found Konan, and they worked together to survive when they were children.
This is an understandable reason as to why she fell in love with him, as well as his personality.
It is unfortunate that his life was cut short, as he probably would have steered the Akatsuki in a different direction.
It was also shown that Konan was willing to entrust her trust in Naruto because he resembled Yahiko.
Masashi Kishimoto designed Konan with a concrete ideaーfor her to be the only female member of the Akatsuki.
This was mentioned inNaruto Hiden: Sha no Sho Character Official Data Bookas well as what she wears underneath the Akatsuki cloak.
